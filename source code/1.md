It does not
really
matters when you break
the line. Except for two line breaks in a

row.

This is a paragraph.

You can emphasize and strongly emphasize any text
with the stars:

* use one star for *italics*,
* double stars for **bold** font and
* three stars to ***mix those*** styles.

---

Using numbers instead of the stars results in an ordered list:
1. where it does not really matters
1. if you increment the numbers or
3. not, but you can create nested lists by indenting
    1. your list elements
    2. by 4 spaces
        * or by more for further levels
        * for further levels

Use *backticks* for inline `code`,

```r
require(graphics)
pairs(mtcars, main = "mtcars data")
coplot(mpg ~ disp | as.factor(cyl), data = mtcars)
```
